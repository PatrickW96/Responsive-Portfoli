                    Hello there! The name is Patrick Whelan but you can choose to call me my prefered: Pat. I am currently a front end web 
                    developer who is training to reach my goal to become a full stack developer. I am just another guy that got really 
                    good using HTML and CSS, currently mastering Bootstrap; and, of course continuing my studies to reach the long term goal
                    all while enjoying the little things in life as they come. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    I specialize in solving your problems and have a strong driven ambition to get any job I am part of done right and with 
                    the quality of someone who takes pride in what they do assured. Desiging and coding websites is the reason I wake up 
                    every morning and what I dream about whhen I go to sleep. It is also the reason I am continually furthering my 
                    education in the field so that I can be the best developer I can be for my clients. Let someone who loves what they 
                    are doing help you with your online needs.                                    
                </p>
