# Responsive-Portfoli
Creating and entirely responsive personal portfolio using Bootstrap CSS frameworks. 


#Introduction
This is a take at my personal project portfolio to be shared with you and those who have any interest in what I am capable of. This is the first design and nothing here is set in stone. In fact you can expect frequent updates to this site for years to come.


#Overview 
This is my personal website where I will be adding future projects as I accomplish them. You might notice that upon for release of this web portfolio it is not anything super spectacular but this just a start. 

I put a bright red brick wall background image to attract attention when you are brought to the webpage. I then attemped to contrast with a linear gradient nude color scheme for the header, the main content of the page, and the footer; even making all the above a little bit transparent. I then added a faded navy blue to contrast on the backgrounf gradient.

For Main Home Page I used 50% width aliged to left for the aesthetics and do plan to add something on the available property next door. However when the screen reaches its breakpoint of 768px the main container becomes 90% width of the screen and center aligned. 

For the Portfolio Page I left the container center aligned at 50% screen width for md and up screens. I was able to align all the pictures is two column rows and even added links to the first two images. Both links are live but not ready for interaction as of right now. I am continually working on projects so expect to see some great stuff soon. 

For the Contact Page I went back to the 50% left aligned look with a 768px breakpoint that increase main contents width to 90% just like the home page. I made the length of the form bubbles change from 75% to 90% width upon said breakpoint as well. 


#Flaws to Project As of Now---
1.
As of right now the collapsable meun icon does not work so it is virtually impossible to travel from page to page on a mobile device for the time being. (expect to see commit saying that was updated soon.) (Also if you have any tips to why my icon would not work I am all ears!)

2.There is no description applied to my Portfolio project so a user would not know that they are not finished and it could become very confusing. I do plan on using JavaScript to add a :hover ability where when the images are hovered over a card with information and the link will pop up instead of the link being directly connected to the images themselves.


#Conclusion 

I am not overall currently impressed with my performace for this project but I do intend to turn the heat up for all upcoming homework assignments as well as continue to add files and commits to this page until it is perfect. I learned a lot during this entire process and also learned that I have alot more to learn. Hope you enjoyed the page. Stayed tuned!
